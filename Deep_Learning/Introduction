Inventors have long dreamed of creating machines that think. This desire dates back to atleast the time of ancient Greece. 

Today, Artificial Intelligence is a thriving field with many practical usages and active research topics. They can automate 
routine labour, understand speech and text, etc

In earlier days of AI, the field rapidly tackled and solved problems that are intellectually difficult for humans but relatively 
straight forward for computers. Problems which can be described by list if formulas and mathematical rules.

However, the true challenge to AI proved to be solving tasks which are easy to humans but hard for 
people to describe-problems that we solve intutively, like recognizing faces, languages and images, etc.

The approach in which computers learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts without 
the need of human opearators to formally specify all of the knowledge that the computer needs is known as *Deep Learning*.  
The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. 
If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. 

Earlier AI was based on *Knowledge Base*. It means the data to AI was hardcoded by humans and based on this data the AI algos.
can come to inferences by looking at the patterns present in this data. This is known as the
knowledge base approach to artificial intelligence. None of these projects has led
to a major success. One of the most famous such projects is Cyc. Cyc is an inference engine and a database of statements in a language
called CycL. These statements are entered by a staff of human supervisors. It is an
unwieldy process.

The difficulties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest
that AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting
patterns from raw data. This capability is known as *Machine learning*.
