Tensors:
Tensors are Multi Dimensional Arrays. 
An array here means is an ordered arrangement of numbers.

If there is only one element in the array, it is called 0 dimensional array/tensor
OR 0-D Array/Tensor.

Example01:

[8] -> here, the single element array or as in TensorFlow is called Tensor is a 0-Dimensional array/ 0-Dimensional Tensor.

Example02:

[2 0 -3] -> here, the 3 element array/tensors is called a 1 Dimensional Array/Tensor.

|19|
|2}
|11| -> These 5 elements in a column is also called a 1 Dimensional Array/Tensor.
|4|
|7|

Example03:

A combination of 1 D Tensors is called as 2 D Tensor.

| 1 2 0 |
| 3 5 -1|
| 1 5 6 | -> A 2-D Tensor
| 2 3 8 |

The above is a 4x3 matrix. In TenorFlow (4,3) is the shape of the tensor.
The above matrix is a combinaton of 4 1-D Tensors

Likewise, a combination of multiple 2-D Tensors is called a 3-D Tensor.
Example04: 
|1 2 0|
|3 5 -1
 |10 2 0|
  |1 0 2|
   |5 8 0|
   |2 7 0|
    |2 1 9|
    |4 -3 32|

The above tensor is of shape(4,2,3).
Refer the jupyter notebook for further details.
